# Zu's 26th Birthday Quest!

1. Study the [zubday2024.py](zubday2024.py) file and figure out its
   output **without actually running it**.
2. The [pdf.7z](pdf.7z) file is encrypted with a SHA-256 hash
   of [zubday2024.py](zubday2024.py)'s output.
   Write a program that generates the appropriate hash.
3. Extract the contents of the [pdf.7z](pdf.7z) file.
4. Read the extracted [README_PDF.md](README_PDF.md) file.
